<h1><font color='White'>Carly's Creative Coding Portfolio</h1>

<p>Hi! My name is Carly and I am currently in my fourth year at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I am a Political Science and English double major, so as you can probably guess, coding is kind of out of my element. I have always wanted to learn at least the basics of coding because I believe coding is an essential part of our daily lives. As time progresses and technology advances, I believe that the ability to code will become even more crucial. I also am very interested in art and more specifically, aesthetics. I recently took a philosophy class titled, "What is Art?". It opened me up to entirely new ways of looking at and understanding art of various mediums. After finding that UIC offered a creative coding course, I decided to take it because of both my desire to learn coding basics and my love of art. I thought this would be a great opportunity to learn to express myself and learn more about art, digitally.</p>

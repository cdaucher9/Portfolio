  <h1><font color='White'>Artist Recreations</h1>

  <h2>These are sketches that I have created over the past few weeks that were inspired by / copies of various artists.<br/> After attempting to code these artworks, I realized just how hard recreating something originally created by hand can be.<br/> There were so many times I wished I could just grab a shape and rotate it myself.</h2>

    <p>Inspired by Wassily Kandinsky's "Circles in a Circle", I attempted to code a much simpler version. A very good friend of mine introduced me to Kandinsky a few years ago. This piece is in a way, a tribute to her. <br/>Click <a href="https://www.wassilykandinsky.net/work-247.php">here</a> to see the original Kandinsky painting.</p>

    <p>A much less cool version of Robert Delaunay's "Premier Disque". The unevenness of Delaunay's colors and the blending of other colors, adds to the texture of the painting. It almost reminds me of water coloring on drawing paper, when the paper begins to fall apart and areas of watercolor clump together.<br/>Click <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Robert_Delaunay%2C_1913%2C_Premier_Disque%2C_134_cm%2C_52.7_inches%2C_Private_collection.jpg">here</a> to see Delaunay's piece.

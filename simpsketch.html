<h1><font color='White'>Simple Sketches</h1>

<h2>These are sketches that I have created over the past few weeks. They were not featured in my sketchbook as my highlighted sketch.
<br>However, I am still proud of them and thought they deserved to be shown.</h2>

<h3>In 5th grade math class, my teacher taught my classmates and I how to draw what you see in this image.
<br>It is something I always found fascinating because when you draw it people are always surprised that it is made <br>entirely out of straight lines. Seeing as I used to draw it all the time, I figured, why not attempt to code it?</h3>

<h2>In 5th grade math class, my teacher taught my classmates and I how to draw what you see in this image.
<br>It is something I always found fascinating because when you draw it people are always surprised that it is made <br>entirely out of straight lines. Seeing as I used to draw it all the time, I figured, why not attempt to code it?</h2>

    <p>I chose the green to blue color scheme to show the simplicity of the drawing while also showing the shapes that are made within the drawing (also because I like the colors blue and green). Being able to see how this first drawing looks, I think also helps to see the shapes within the following drawings.</p>

    <p>Here I wanted to make a slightly more complex version of the first picture, while keeping the same transition of colors to show the hidden shapes within it. The darker orange octagon was an unexpected shape that appeared. Since I used cool colors on the first drawing, I went for warmer colors to contrast the first drawing.</p>

    <p>For this third drawing, I was just curious to see what an even more complex image would look like. At first I was worried I had messed up while coding when the red line in this drawing came out more square than the other lines. For the colors I looked to the 70s for inspiration, since I had already used cool and warm colors.</p>
